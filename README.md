### Stack

A stack is an Abstract Data Type (ADT),it is LIFO data structure. LIFO stands for Last-in-first-out.
A stack can be implemented by means of Array, Structure, Pointer, and Linked List.

**Basic Operations**:

- **Push()** − Pushing (storing) an element on the stack.
- **pop()** − Removing (accessing) an element from the stack.

the following functionality is also required to stacks

- **peek()** − get the top data element of the stack, without removing it.
- **isFull()** − check if stack is full.
- **isEmpty()** − check if stack is empty.
